Such as there have two hosts A(192.168.11.46) and B(192.168.10.132), we assume login B from A without password, we can follow below steps

1. login A 
2. generate the rsa/dsa public key by "ssh-keygen -t [rsa|dsa]"
3. cd ~/.ssh/ and copy id_rsa.pub or id_dsa.pub to B
4. login B
5. "cd ~/.ssh" and "cat id_dsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"



Tips

make sure the priviledge of authorized_keys is 644 on host B, otherwise, still need to type password.



output example:

âžœ  ~ ssh joeyyu@192.168.10.132
Last login: Wed Apr 20 16:18:31 2016 from 192.168.11.46
[joeyyu@localhost ~]$
